# Sailing Plugin

An automated sailing plugin that supports salvaging shipwrecks while sailing.

## Features

### Salvaging
- **Automatic Shipwreck Detection**: Finds and salvages nearby shipwrecks within a 15-tile radius
- **Smart Inventory Management**: Checks inventory status before attempting to salvage — clears a full inventory before looking for new wrecks
- **Salvaging Station Support**: Deposits salvage at your boat's salvaging station (if installed), unless **Use Cargo Hold** is enabled
- **Cargo Hold (optional)**: Opens the hold and uses **Deposit inventory** in the cargo UI; tracks occupied slots and salvage stacks from the hold grid. When the hold is full or nearly full, withdraws and runs the same alch/drop/casket pipeline until salvage stacks in the hold are cleared. Avoids unnecessary hold open/close while idle away from wrecks without salvage
- **Hook Deployment**: Automatically deploys your boat's salvaging hook on nearby shipwrecks

### Inventory Management
- **High Alching**: Exhausts all stacks of each configured item before moving to the next (fixed from original single-item-per-name behaviour)
- **Configurable Alch Order**: Choose the order items are alched across your inventory
- **Casket Opening**: Optionally open all caskets before alching/dropping to maximise loot
- **Junk Dropping**: Drops configured junk items — runs before casket opening and again after to catch any junk from casket loot
- **Salvage Deposition**: Deposits salvage at salvaging stations for processing

### Visual Highlighting
- **Active Wrecks**: Highlights shipwrecks you can salvage (green by default)
- **Inactive Wrecks**: Highlights depleted shipwrecks/stumps (gray by default)
- **High Level Wrecks**: Highlights shipwrecks above your sailing level (red by default)
- **Customizable Colors**: All highlight colors are fully customizable
- Wreck data for the overlay is updated on each game tick on the client thread so highlights stay in sync with the scene

## Configuration

### General Settings

**Salvaging** (default: disabled)
- Enable this to start the salvaging automation

**Enable Alching** (default: disabled)
- Automatically high alch valuable items when inventory is full
- Requires nature runes and fire runes/staff

**Alch Items** (default: rings and bracelets)
- Comma-separated list of items to high alch
- Default: `gold ring, sapphire ring, emerald ring, ruby ring, diamond ring, ruby bracelet, emerald bracelet, diamond bracelet, mithril scimitar`
- All stacks of each item are fully alched before moving to the next item on the list

**Open Caskets** (default: disabled)
- When enabled, opens all caskets in your inventory as part of the full-inventory routine
- Caskets are opened after the first drop pass (to ensure space for loot) and before alching
- Any junk from casket loot is caught by a second drop pass after alching

**Use Cargo Hold** (default: disabled)
- When enabled, you must be on your boat with a cargo hold in range. The script opens the hold to learn capacity, reads **occupied slots** and **salvage stacks** from the hold item grid, and when your inventory is full of salvage it uses **Deposit inventory** in the cargo UI (instead of the salvaging station).
- When the hold has no free slots, or its free slots are fewer than your current empty inventory slots, the script withdraws salvage from the hold and runs the same drop/casket/alch steps as a full inventory until **salvage stacks in the hold** reach zero, then continues salvaging (other items may still occupy slots).
- While you are idle with no nearby wreck and no salvage in inventory, the script does not keep opening the hold only to refresh counts.
- Turn this off to restore the original station-only behaviour. If the hold is not available (wrong place, no hold), salvaging waits until it can initialise the hold.

**Alch Order** (default: LIST_ORDER)
- Controls the order in which matching items are alched across your inventory
- `LIST_ORDER` — alches by item name order in your Alch Items list (original behaviour)
- `LEFT_TO_RIGHT` — sweeps inventory row by row, left to right (slot 0 → 27)
- `RIGHT_TO_LEFT` — sweeps inventory row by row, right to left
- `TOP_TO_BOTTOM` — sweeps inventory column by column, top to bottom (slot 0, 4, 8... then 1, 5, 9...)
- `BOTTOM_TO_TOP` — sweeps inventory column by column, bottom to top

**Drop Items** (default: common junk)
- Comma-separated list of items to drop when inventory is full
- Default includes: caskets, oyster pearls, logs, nails, planks, seeds, repair kits, etc.

### Salvaging Highlight Settings

**Enable Highlighting** (default: enabled)
- Toggle shipwreck highlighting overlay

**Highlight Active Wrecks** (default: enabled)
- Highlight shipwrecks you can salvage

**Active Wrecks Colour** (default: green)

**Highlight Inactive Wrecks** (default: disabled)
- Highlight depleted shipwrecks (stumps)

**Inactive Wrecks Colour** (default: gray)

**Highlight High Level Wrecks** (default: disabled)
- Highlight shipwrecks above your sailing level

**High Level Wrecks Colour** (default: red)

## How It Works

1. **Inventory Check First**: On each tick, the plugin checks whether inventory is full before looking for wrecks
2. **If inventory is full**:
   - If salvage items are present → open cargo hold and **Deposit inventory** (**Use Cargo Hold**), else salvaging station (or drop junk if no station)
   - Otherwise:
     1. Drop configured junk items
     2. Open caskets (if enabled) — space has been made by the drop step
     3. High alch configured items (if enabled) — includes any loot from opened caskets
     4. Drop again — catches any junk that came from casket loot
3. **If inventory has space** and there is no salvage to protect: if **Open Caskets**, **Drop Items**, or **Enable Alching** would still change the inventory, the plugin may run one cleanup pass (same order as step 2) before looking for wrecks
4. **If inventory has space** after that: find the nearest wreck and deploy the salvaging hook
5. **Repeat**

## Shipwreck Types

| Barracuda Shipwreck | 35 |

| Merchant Shipwreck | 87 |

## Tips

- **Recommended Worlds**: Use world 596 or 597 for the best salvaging experience
- **Boat Equipment**: Ensure your boat has a salvaging hook installed
- **Salvaging Station**: Install a salvaging station on your boat to automatically process salvage
- **Alching Setup**: Ensure you have nature runes and a fire staff (or fire runes) for high alching
- **Casket Tip**: If using Open Caskets, consider removing "casket" from your Drop Items list so caskets are opened rather than dropped
- **Alch Order**: If your alching looks robotic, try `LEFT_TO_RIGHT` or `TOP_TO_BOTTOM` for more natural-looking inventory traversal
- **Inventory Space**: The plugin considers inventory "full" at 24-28 items (randomized) to handle salvage variations

## Requirements

- Sailing skill unlocked
- A boat with a salvaging hook installed
- Nature runes for alching (if enabled)
- Fire runes or fire staff for alching (if enabled)

## Optional Equipment

- **Salvaging Station**: Install on your boat to automatically process salvage items (recommended)
- Without a salvaging station, the plugin will drop junk items when inventory fills with salvage

## Known Limitations

- Requires shipwrecks to be within 15 tiles of the player
- Will wait if player is already animating (salvaging)
- Without a salvaging station, salvage items will be dropped when inventory is full
- Casket opening requires at least one free inventory slot — the drop pass before opening handles this in normal usage

## Version History

**2.2.34**
- Reliable **shipwreck highlights** via per-tick client-side wreck snapshots for the overlay
- **Cargo hold**: **Deposit inventory** in the UI, separate **salvage stack** vs **slot** tracking, smarter resync (no idle spam), earlier hold initialisation, improved hold object lookup
- **Full inventory + cargo hold**: full salvage inventories deposit or enter hold processing instead of deploying the hook
- **Idle inventory cleanup** when there is no salvage but casket/drop/alch work remains

**2.2.0**
- Optional **Use Cargo Hold** mode for salvaging: deposit salvage into the boat hold, process the hold when full or nearly full, then resume hooks

**2.1.0**
- Fixed alch loop only alching one of each item instead of exhausting all stacks
- Fixed inventory check now happens before wreck detection
- Added Open Caskets option
- Added Alch Order config with five modes: LIST_ORDER, LEFT_TO_RIGHT, RIGHT_TO_LEFT, TOP_TO_BOTTOM, BOTTOM_TO_TOP

**2.0.1**
- Automatic shipwreck salvaging
- Inventory management with alching and dropping
- Shipwreck highlighting overlay
